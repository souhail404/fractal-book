                        It all started in Dith's garden... <br /> <br />
                        A one-eyed stray cat appeared out of nowhere, like a glitch in the matrix. Scrappy, silent, and somehow staring straight into your soul with his single eye. He didn’t meow. He didn’t beg. He simply existed, defiantly, unapologetically. <br /> <br />

                        Dith’s wife said he stays. <br /> <br />
                        Dith agreed... on one condition: he gets to name him. <br /> <br />
                        Thus, Cyclops was born, and the legend began. <br /> <br />

                        But this was no ordinary adoption tale. <br /> <br />
                        As fate would have it, Cyclops was destined for something bigger than sunbathing on patio tiles. The Abstract Chain, home of consumer crypto, meme magic, and degenerate dreams, found him. Or maybe he found it.
                        <br /> <br />
                        And the chain reacted like it always does: chaotically, instantly, collectively.<br /> <br />
                        Suddenly, Cyclops was tokenized by the community. <br /> <br />
                        He wasn’t just a stray cat anymore, he was the chosen one. <br /> <br />

                        Playful. Intelligent. Fearless. Adaptive. <br /> <br />
                        A pixelated prophet for a decentralized age. <br /> <br />
                        A digital deity with a twitchy tail and one all-seeing eye. <br /> <br />
                        He became a symbol, of survival, of silliness, of pure memetic destiny. <br /> <br />

                        Cyclops gives zero f*cks. <br /> <br />

                        He’s not just part of the household. <br /> <br />
                        He’s part of the chain now. <br /> <br />
                        He’s yours, and he’s everyone’s. <br /> <br />

                        One eye. Nine lives. Infinite possibilities. <br /> <br />
                        Welcome to the cult of Cyclops. <br /> <br />
